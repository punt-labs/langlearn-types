# Agent Instructions

This project follows [Punt Labs standards](https://github.com/punt-labs/punt-kit).

## No "Pre-existing" Excuse

There is no such thing as a "pre-existing" issue. If you see a problem — in code you wrote, code a reviewer flagged, or code you happen to be reading — you fix it. Do not classify issues as "pre-existing" to justify ignoring them. Do not suggest that something is "outside the scope of this change." If it is broken and you can see it, it is your problem now.

## Scratch Files

Use `.tmp/` at the project root for scratch and temporary files — never `/tmp`. The `TMPDIR` environment variable is set via `.envrc` so that `tempfile` and subprocesses automatically use it. Contents are gitignored; only `.gitkeep` is tracked.

## Quality Gates

Run before every commit. Zero violations, zero errors, all tests green.

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy src/ tests/
uv run pyright src/ tests/
uv run pytest
```

## Documentation Discipline

### CHANGELOG

Entries are written in the PR branch, before merge — not retroactively on main. If a PR changes user-facing behavior and the diff does not include a CHANGELOG entry, the PR is not ready to merge. Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Add entries under `## [Unreleased]`. Categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.

### README

Update `README.md` when user-facing behavior changes — new types, interfaces, defaults, or configuration. The README is the first thing consumers see; it must stay current with the code.

### PR/FAQ

Update `prfaq.tex` when a change shifts product direction or validates/invalidates a risk assumption. If the change is routine (bug fix, refactor, test coverage), no PR/FAQ update is needed.

## Pre-PR Checklist

- [ ] **CHANGELOG entry included in the PR diff** under `## [Unreleased]` (not retroactively on main)
- [ ] **README updated** if user-facing behavior changed (new types, interfaces)
- [ ] **PR/FAQ updated** if the change shifts product direction or validates/invalidates a risk
- [ ] **Quality gates pass**

## Code Review Flow

Do **not** merge immediately after creating a PR. Expect **2–6 review cycles** before merging.

1. **Create PR** — push branch, open PR via `mcp__github__create_pull_request`. Prefer MCP GitHub tools over `gh` CLI.
2. **Request Copilot review** — use `mcp__github__request_copilot_review`.
3. **Watch for feedback in the background** — `gh pr checks <number> --watch` in a background task or separate session. Do not stop waiting. Copilot and Bugbot may take 1–3 minutes after CI completes.
4. **Read all feedback** via MCP: `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `get_reviews` and `get_review_comments`.
5. **Take every comment seriously.** There is no such thing as "pre-existing" or "unrelated to this change" — if you can see it, you own it. If you disagree, explain why in a reply.
6. **Fix and re-push** — commit fixes, push, re-run quality gates.
7. **Repeat steps 3–6** until the latest review is **uneventful** — zero new comments, all checks green.
8. **Merge only when the last review was clean** — use `mcp__github__merge_pull_request` (not `gh pr merge`).

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **beads** (`bd`) for issue tracking. If an issue discovered here affects multiple repos or requires a standards change, escalate to a [punt-kit bead](https://github.com/punt-labs/punt-kit) instead (see [bead placement scheme](../CLAUDE.md#where-to-create-a-bead)).
